## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Git Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement distributed architecture for multi-platform deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. InfinityFree Deployment
1. Upload all PHP files to InfinityFree hosting
2. Import `database/psau_admission.sql` to MySQL database
3. Update database credentials in `includes/db_connect.php`
4. Set proper file permissions for uploads/ and images/ directories
5. Test the main application at your InfinityFree domain

### 3. Replit Deployment
1. Create new Python Repl on Replit.com
2. Upload contents of `python/image/` directory
3. Set environment variables:
   ```
   DB_HOST=your-infinityfree-db-host
   DB_USER=your-infinityfree-db-user
   DB_PASS=your-infinityfree-db-password
   DB_NAME=your-infinityfree-db-name
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-infinityfree-domain.infinityfreeapp.com
   ```
4. Wait for dependencies to install (5-10 minutes)
5. Run the application and note the URL

### 4. Configuration Updates
1. Update `includes/python_api.php` with your Replit URL
2. Update `python/image/app.py` with your InfinityFree domain
3. Test API connectivity between services

### 5. Testing
1. Test PHP application functionality
2. Test Python service endpoints
3. Test cross-platform communication
4. Test file uploads and OCR processing
5. Test chatbot and recommendation features

## üîç Testing Checklist

### PHP Application Tests
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] File upload functionality
- [ ] Database connectivity
- [ ] Admin panel access
- [ ] Application submission

### Python Service Tests
- [ ] Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [ ] OCR service (`/ocr_service`)
- [ ] Chatbot service (`/ask_question`)
- [ ] Recommendation service (`/api/recommend`)
- [ ] Database connectivity

### Integration Tests
- [ ] PHP to Python API calls
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] File upload to OCR processing
- [ ] Chatbot integration
- [ ] Course recommendation integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Check allowed origins in `python/image/app.py`
   - Ensure your domain is included in CORS configuration

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database credentials
   - Check if external connections are allowed
   - Test database connectivity from each platform

3. **Python Service Not Responding**
   - Check Replit logs for errors
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check environment variables

4. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check directory permissions
   - Verify upload limits
   - Check available disk space

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check logs in each platform's dashboard
2. Use browser developer tools to debug API calls
3. Test each service individually
4. Refer to the DEPLOYMENT.md guide

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ PHP application runs on InfinityFree
- ‚úÖ Python services run on Replit
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform communication works
- ‚úÖ All features function correctly
- ‚úÖ File uploads and processing work
- ‚úÖ AI services respond properly

## üìù Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Monitor system performance
2. Set up regular backups
3. Monitor logs for issues
4. Plan for scaling if needed
5. Consider additional features
