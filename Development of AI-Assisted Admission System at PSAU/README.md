4. Node.js and npm (for Firebase Functions)

### Database Setup

1. Start XAMPP and ensure MySQL service is running
2. Import the database schema from `/database/psau_admission.sql`
3. Default credentials are:
   - Host: localhost
   - Username: root
   - Password: (blank)
   - Database: psau_admission

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password and Phone
3. Set up Realtime Database
4. Set up Cloud Functions with the following environment variables:
   ```
   firebase functions:config:set gmail.email="jericogutierrezsison12@gmail.com" gmail.password="crsh iejc lhwz gasu"
   ```
5. Deploy functions from the `/functions` directory

### Python Setup

Install required Python packages:
```
pip install pytesseract pdf2image
```

You also need to install Tesseract OCR engine on your system.

### System Setup

1. Clone or download the project to your XAMPP htdocs directory
2. Configure the database connection in `/includes/db_connect.php` if needed
3. Configure the Firebase project details in your client-side scripts
4. Ensure the `/uploads` directory is writable by the web server

## System Architecture

- **Public Interface**: User-facing pages in `/public` directory
- **Admin Interface**: Administration pages in `/admin` directory
- **Backend Functions**: Reusable PHP scripts in `/includes` directory
- **Firebase Functions**: Cloud functions in `/functions` directory
- **Python Scripts**: PDF processing in `/python` directory

## Security Features

# PSAU Admission System - Firebase Email Integration

This guide explains how to set up and use the Firebase email integration for the PSAU Admission System.

## Overview

The system now uses Firebase Cloud Functions for all email notifications, including:
- Application verification emails
- Application rejection/resubmission emails
- Test emails

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project" and follow the setup steps
3. Name your project (e.g., "psau-admission-system")
4. Follow the prompts to complete setup

### 2. Set Up Firebase Cloud Functions

1. Install the Firebase CLI:
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. Login to Firebase:
```
firebase login
```

3. Initialize your project:
```
mkdir functions
cd functions
firebase init functions
```

4. Create the Cloud Functions code in your `functions` directory:
   - `index.js`: Contains the Cloud Functions for email sending
   - `package.json`: Contains dependencies

5. Install dependencies:
```
cd functions
npm install
```

6. Deploy functions:
```
firebase deploy --only functions
```

7. After deployment, Firebase will show the URL for your Cloud Function. Copy this URL.

### 3. Update Firebase Configuration

1. Open `firebase_email.php` in your project
2. Update the Firebase configuration:
```php
$firebase_config = [
    'api_key' => 'YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY', // From Firebase console
    'project_id' => 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    'email_function_url' => 'YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL'
];
```

## Testing the Integration

1. Use the Firebase Console to test your cloud functions
2. Monitor the cloud function logs in Firebase Console to confirm proper email delivery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**:
   - Check your Firebase Cloud Function logs in the Firebase Console
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check that the Cloud Function URL is correct

2. **Function deployment errors**:
   - Make sure you've installed all dependencies
   - Check that your Firebase project is properly set up
   - Verify your `package.json` has the right dependencies

3. **Integration errors**:
   - Check PHP error logs for detailed error messages
   - Make sure the Firebase email functions are being included properly
   - Verify that cURL is enabled in your PHP configuration

## File Structure

- `firebase_email.php`: Main integration file with email functions
- `functions/`: Contains Cloud Function code for deployment
  - `index.js`: Cloud Functions for email sending
  - `package.json`: Node.js dependencies

## Using the Integration

To send an email from your PHP code:

```php
// Include the Firebase email functions
require_once 'firebase_email.php';

// Send a verification email
$user = [
    'email' => 'user@example.com',
    'first_name' => 'John',
    'last_name' => 'Doe'
];
$result = send_verification_email($user);

// Send a resubmission email
$reason = "Missing documents";
$result = send_resubmission_email($user, $reason);

// Send a custom email
$to = 'user@example.com';
$subject = 'Custom Email';
$message = '<p>This is a custom email message.</p>';
$result = firebase_send_email($to, $subject, $message);
```
